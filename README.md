## üìñ My Story

Hello everyone, I'm Himanshu Soni, a full-stack developer with a passion for creating innovative and impactful software solutions. My journey into the world of technology began with a spark of curiosity and a fascination with computers from a young age.

In 2012, I took my first steps into web development, learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This was just the beginning of my exploration of the limitless possibilities that technology offered.

During my graduation in Electronics and Communications Engineering, I sought to apply my growing knowledge of computer technology to real-world problems. I delved into programming languages like C++ and Python, building hobby projects like an IoT light control system and a smart surveillance system that used Python for real-time object detection.

My entrepreneurial spirit led me to create an e-commerce website for my jewelry business in 2020. This project not only honed my web development skills but also instilled in me a deep understanding of user experience and the importance of creating intuitive interfaces.

My professional journey took a significant turn when I joined Cheer Infinity, where I built simple websites for clients. This hands-on experience allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios and gain valuable insights into the industry.

Driven by my passion for data analysis and problem-solving, I landed an internship as a data analyst at The Kabadiwala in 2021. Working with enterprise-level data was an eye-opening experience, revealing the vast potential of data-driven decision-making.

During my time at The Kabadiwala, I identified an opportunity to improve their request routing process, which was manual and inefficient. I developed a routing solution that significantly optimized their workflow, demonstrating my ability to identify and solve problems through technology.

Seeking more exposure to production-level applications, I joined Autowriter.ai, where I created a Shopify plugin for generating product descriptions. This plugin has been embraced by over 10,000 users, showcasing the impact that technology can have on a large scale.

In 2022, I joined RoaDo, a startup brimming with energy and innovation. I relished the opportunity to tackle complex challenges and contribute to the development of features like custom reports and RFQ modules. This experience further refined my skills and broadened my understanding of software development best practices.

My journey has been one of continuous learning, adaptation, and innovation. I've embraced challenges as opportunities to grow, and I've never shied away from exploring new technologies and methodologies.

Today, I stand at the crossroads, eager to embark on the next chapter of my software development adventure. I'm actively seeking opportunities to work with teams of experts, tackle cutting-edge projects, and make a meaningful contribution to the ever-evolving world of technology.

As I look back on my journey, I'm filled with gratitude for the experiences, the mentors, and the colleagues who have shaped my path. I'm excited to see what the future holds, confident that my passion for technology and my commitment to excellence will lead me to even greater achievements.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. I hope our paths cross in the future!
